# MobileEdgesim
We developed a tool called MobileEdgesim designed to simulate microservices-oriented mobile edge computing environments.

Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emerging computing paradigm that is receiving growing attention. MEC significantly reduces latency by processing user requests on edge servers rather than cloud centers, making it ideal for real-time applications. However, due to resource limitations and user mobility, microservice requests may fail, especially when users move at high speeds. This paper introduces a new tool, MobileEdgeSim, designed to simulate microservice-oriented MEC environments. MobileEdgeSim integrates mobility prediction and service composition to enhance the pre-deployment of microservices. To evaluate MobileEdgeSim, we conducted a series of experiments comparing it to several state-of-the-art baseline approaches. We also conducted a user study to evaluate the tool's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our results indicate that MobileEdgeSim significantly improves the success rate of both user requests and responses while reducing resource costs.
